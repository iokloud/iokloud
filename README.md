# IOKloud
## Easy Installer for Scalable IoT and Mobile backend server
You may decide to run a Mobile or IoT backend server and you need a chain tools and services that take a long time to setup and configure it. This was an idea for **IOKloud** to solve and easy for developers. **IOKloud** install **Kuzzle**, **Elasticsearch**, **Redis**, **MQTT** and **Websocket** **AEDES** broker, **Wordpress** with SSO plugin, **Keycloak**, **PostgreSQL**, **Minio** and configure **Docker-Compose** or **Kubernetes** without requiring knowledge on orchestration just by a YAML file.
Now, it just test against Ubuntu and did not test in other distributions. IOKloud run in Docker-Compose and Kubernetes.
